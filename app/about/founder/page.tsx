                They recite wins from inside the sandbox—safe, sanctioned, expected. This isn't that. 
                This is the anomaly your instincts clocked before your mind could name it. The system 
                doesn't contain him. He doesn't *bend* rules—he erases the concept. That "Holy F*ck" 
                ripple crawling up your spine? That's recognition. You just met the variable they 
                never accounted for.
